Setup UI for the Chatbot (Phase 1): 
1. Chatbot
2. Streamlit
3. Usage from the UI

Connect to LLM (Phase 2):
1. Langchain
2. Groq

Integrate RAG (Phase 3):
1. Upload document(s)
2. Vector Embeddings
3. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Basics : 
1. Models are trained up to a limit
2. No proprietary information access
3. Answers from specific sources
4. Reduce Hallucinations

Vector Embeddings : 
6. Numerical representations of words or phrases
7. Capture meanings and relationships
8. Helps machine learning models understand text effectively

Improvement Potential/Next Steps

1. Add authentication in the UI
2. Make use of upload document functionality
3. Add multiple documents and embed them together
4. Add Unit testing of RAG applications
5. Connect the Chatbot to access the internet as well in addition to the file

Summary 

1. Modern AI Chatbot for documents

3. Worked with : 
    a. Streamlit
    b. Langchain
    c. RAG
    d. Groq
    e. Vector Embeddings
    f. End to End RAG Pipeline
4. Future Possibilities
